description: Reproduce, shrink and permanently capture flaky Go tests.
---

Reproduce a flaky Go test in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes, shrink it to the
smallest polluter→victim witness, and leave a permanent regression test behind.

```sh
go install github.com/emrelab/go-flake-hunter/cmd/go-flake-hunter@v0.3.0
```
